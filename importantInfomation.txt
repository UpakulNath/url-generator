There are two main types of HTTP redirects:

301 Redirect (Permanent)
Means: “This short link always goes to the same destination.”
→ The browser or search engine might remember this redirection.

302 Redirect (Temporary)
Means: “This redirect might change later.”
→ The browser will not cache it permanently, and every time someone clicks the short link, it will ask the backend again for the destination.
